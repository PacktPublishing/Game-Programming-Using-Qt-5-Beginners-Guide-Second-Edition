# Game Programming using Qt 5 Beginner’s Guide, Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Game Programming using Qt 5 Beginner’s Guide, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/game-programming-using-qt-beginners-guide-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788399999), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Qt is the leading cross-platform toolkit for all significant desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms and is becoming more popular by the day, especially on mobile and embedded devices. It's a powerful tool that perfectly fits the needs of game developers. You only need to create your game once and deploy it on all major platforms such as iOS, Android, and WinRT, without changing a single source file. This book will help you learn the nitty-gritty of Qt and will equip you with the necessary toolsets to build apps and games.

The book begins with a brief introduction to creating an application and preparing a working environment for both desktop and mobile platforms. You will learn how to use built-in Qt widgets and Form Editor to create a classic GUI application. You'll then explore the basics of creating graphical interfaces and Qt's core concepts (data processing and display) that will help you create high-performance games.

As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn to enrich your games by implementing network connectivity and employing scripting. You will learn about Qt's capabilities for handling strings and files, data storage, and serialization.

Moving on, you will also learn about the new Qt Gamepad module and how to add it in your game. You'll then delve into OpenGL, and how it can be used in Qt applications to implement hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics. You will then explore various facets of Qt Quick: how it can be used in games to add game logic and design animations, add game physics, and build astonishing UIs for your games.

By the end of this book, you will have developed the skillset to develop interesting games with Qt.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
QNetworkRequest request;
request.setUrl(QUrl("http://localhost/version.txt"));
request.setHeader(QNetworkRequest::UserAgentHeader, "MyGame");
m_manager->get(request);
```

You don't need to own or install any particular software before starting to work with the book. A common Windows, Linux, or MacOS system should be sufficient. Chapter 2, Installation, contains detailed instructions on how to download and set up everything you'll need.

In this book, you will find several headings that appear frequently:

The Time for action section contains clear instructions on how to complete a procedure or task.
The What just happened? section explains the working of the tasks or instructions that you have just completed.
The Have a go hero sections contain practical challenges that give you ideas to experiment with what you have learned.
The Pop quiz sections contain short single-choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding. You will find the answers at the end of the book.
While going through the chapters, you will be presented with multiple games and other projects as well as detailed descriptions of how to create them. We advise you to try to create these projects yourself using the instructions we'll give you. If at any point of time you have trouble following the instructions or don't know how to do a certain step, you should take a pick at the example code files to see how it can be done. However, the most important and exciting part of learning is to decide what you want to implement and then find a way to do it, so pay attention to the "Have a go hero" sections or think of your own way to improve each project.
